# DevBox
## Info
Born from the ashes of [DevUtilities](https://github.com/VikSn0w/DevUtilities), DevBox has the same mission of its predecessor but with SwiftUI and collaboration with other members of the community. 

In short: DevBox is an application that provides plenty of utilities for coding, coded for coders. It has the necessary for fast calculations and operations, like Bitwise operations, Conversions, IP Operations and many more functions!

## Project Status
The project was reset after almost 3 years of inactivity and 5 years since the first release. The main reason of the reset and the creation of an another project is that the 99% of the code and all the UI was (badly) done with the static Storyboard approach. Since I wanted to learn SwiftUI and the task of basically dismantle a whole project and building it again with a whole different infrastructure seemed not worth the effort, I chose to start from ground zero.

## What I'm currently working on
At the moment I'm focusing on redesigning ad replicating the pages of the Coding Tab, by leaving as the last one the Color Page, where I want to experiment a bit with Image Analysis in Swift.

## What has been done so far

The base UI has been laid down and defined, with improvements in code readability
